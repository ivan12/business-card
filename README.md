An interactive and stylized **business card in JSON editor format**.

## 📌 Overview

- **Main file:** `index.html` — contains the business card, editor-style UI, and all JavaScript logic.
- **Styling:** CSS inside `index.html` (dark theme, code editor look & feel).
- **Interaction:** Drag the card, window control buttons (close/minimize/restore), edit fields via modal, and save data to `localStorage`.
